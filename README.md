# foosball
A rating calculator for the office foosball league

Maintains a leader board using a ratings system, BBT,
based on SkillScore and Elo.

The more games you play the less variance on your rating.
Compete against better rated player (and win) to improve
your rating the most.

It seems more far when not everyone has time to play as
often as others. Also those who have a good streak still
cannot rest on their laurels.

We are currently testing the software in-house with a lot
of games. Figuring out what makes sense and what doesn't.

Ease of use and a nice layout ensures that all games get tracked.
